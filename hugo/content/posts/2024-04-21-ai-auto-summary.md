## Possible consequences of current developments


1. **How important is leetcode in ML?**

   - *Benefits:*
     
     Leetcode can help individuals improve their problem-solving skills, algorithmic thinking, and coding abilities, which are essential in machine learning (ML) projects. It can also provide practical experience in implementing ML algorithms and techniques, making it a valuable resource for aspiring ML engineers.

   - *Ramifications:*
   
     Overemphasizing Leetcode may lead to a narrow focus on competitive programming skills rather than comprehensive understanding of ML concepts. While Leetcode can be beneficial, it should be balanced with learning foundational ML principles and real-world application of ML techniques.

2. **Meta's H100 figure represents its H100 purchase as per company earnings call 1 Feb 2024. Excludes a further 250,000 H100 equivalents worth of GPU.**

3. **How much should I emphasize on traditional ML knowledge when I recruit?**

4. **llama-3-70b on Groq with code interpreting**

5. **Toward Self-Improvement of LLMs via Imagination, Searching, and Criticizing**

6. **How does GPT understand what it does not know?**

## GPT predicts future events


- **Artificial general intelligence** (March 2030)
    - This prediction is based on rapid advancements in AI technology and the increasing interest and investment in research towards achieving AGI. As more resources are dedicated to this goal, it is likely that AGI could be achieved by 2030.
  
- **Technological singularity** (August 2045)
    - The technological singularity is a more speculative prediction as it refers to a hypothetical moment when AI surpasses human intelligence and leads to an explosion of technological growth. While there is debate about whether this event will occur or not, if AGI is achieved by 2030, it could pave the way for the singularity to occur by 2045.
