## Possible consequences of current developments


1. **Are GNNs obsolete because of transformers?**

   - *Benefits:*
     The rise of transformers has led to more efficient and powerful models across various domains, including natural language processing and computer vision. This could allow for a unified framework that streamlines research and deployment, making it easier for developers to integrate complex models into real-world applications. By potentially superseding Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), transformers could facilitate broader accessibility and lower resource requirements in graph-based tasks.

   - *Ramifications:*
     Declaring GNNs obsolete may stifle innovation in areas where they excel. GNNs are particularly potent for tasks involving relational data and networks, such as social network analysis or molecular graph interpretation. Ignoring their unique advantages could lead to suboptimal solutions and hinder advancements in domains that rely heavily on graph structures. Additionally, a shift in focus might consolidate the field around fewer techniques, reducing diversity of thought and exploration.

2. **The Recurrent Delusion: How ML Collectively Forgot What RNNs Were Built For**

   - *Benefits:*
     By revisiting the original purpose of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), researchers may rediscover their strengths, especially in time-series and sequential data tasks. This might inspire innovative applications that leverage RNNs, improving model robustness and learning efficiency in real-time systems, such as autonomous vehicles and speech recognition.

   - *Ramifications:*
     The collective oversight of RNNs' applications could lead to wasted resources on models better suited for different tasks, resulting in inefficiencies in development and deployment timelines. If RNNs are ignored, potential advancements in temporal data processing may be lost, ultimately impairing technologies that rely on historical data trends.

## GPT predicts future events


- **Artificial General Intelligence** (April 2028)  
  The development of AGI is likely to occur within the next decade as advancements in machine learning, natural language processing, and computational power continue to grow exponentially. With increasing investment in AI research and a better understanding of cognitive processes, it seems plausible that a breakthrough could lead to AGI around this time.

- **Technological Singularity** (December 2035)  
  The technological singularity, where AI surpasses human intelligence and begins to improve itself autonomously, might occur in the decade following AGI's emergence. As AGI systems evolve and integrate, their capacity to enhance their own problem-solving capabilities could lead to rapid advancements, resulting in a singularity by the mid-2030s.
