## Possible consequences of current developments


1. **Hi I'm a senior machine learning engineer, looking for buddies to build cool stuff with!**

   - *Benefits:*
     
     Building a network of like-minded individuals can lead to collaboration on innovative projects, sharing of knowledge and expertise, and potentially creating groundbreaking solutions in the field of machine learning.

   - *Ramifications:*
     
     Without proper vetting and collaboration, there could be challenges in finding reliable partners to work with, potential conflicts of interest, and difficulties in coordinating schedules and workloads.

2. **ML Researchers in Industry: How Do You Find Time to Publish Papers?**

   - *Benefits:*
     
     Sharing research findings through publications can lead to recognition in the field, career advancement opportunities, and contributions to the overall knowledge base of machine learning.

   - *Ramifications:*
     
     Balancing time between research, work responsibilities, and paper writing can be challenging, potential competition with peers for publication opportunities, and pressure to constantly produce results for publication.

3. **AMD MI300X and Nvidia H100 benchmarking in FFT: VkFFT, cuFFT and rocFFT comparison**

   - *Benefits:*

     Benchmarking different hardware and software combinations can lead to insights on performance, efficiency, and compatibility, which can inform decision-making for researchers and industry professionals.

   - *Ramifications:*

     Depending on the results, there could be implications for future hardware or software choices, potential biases in the benchmarking process, and challenges in extrapolating findings to different contexts.

4. **Evolutionary Strategy vs. Backpropagation**

   - *Benefits:*

     Comparing different optimization methods can lead to a better understanding of their strengths and weaknesses, potential improvements in algorithm design, and insights into the underlying principles of machine learning.

   - *Ramifications:*

     Depending on the context, one method may be more suitable than the other, potential challenges in implementation and interpretation of results, and the need for further research to validate findings.

5. **Papers proposing ideas without results?**

   - *Benefits:*

     Proposing new ideas can spark creativity, lead to potential breakthroughs in research, and encourage collaboration and discussion within the scientific community.

   - *Ramifications:*

     Lack of results may raise questions about the validity of the proposed ideas, potential challenges in replicating or testing the ideas, and the need for further experimentation to validate the hypotheses.

6. **Which journals/conferences can I possibly submit my ML research on computational fluid dynamics?**

   - *Benefits:*

     Identifying appropriate venues for publication can increase visibility and impact of research, foster collaboration with experts in the field, and provide opportunities for feedback and recognition.

   - *Ramifications:*

     Selecting the wrong journal or conference may lead to rejection or limited visibility, challenges in navigating the publication process, and potential biases in the review and evaluation of the research.
