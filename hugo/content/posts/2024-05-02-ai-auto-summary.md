## Possible consequences of current developments


1. **KAN: Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks**

   - *Benefits:*
   
     KAN has the potential to revolutionize network architecture by leveraging the principles of graph theory and complex systems. This could lead to more efficient and robust networks with better performance and scalability.

   - *Ramifications:*
   
     However, the complexity of KAN could also pose challenges in terms of implementation and maintenance. Moreover, there could be concerns regarding the interpretability of the network's decisions and the potential for unintended consequences in real-world applications.

2. **I reproduced Anthropic's recent interpretability research**

   - ...
   
3. **Modern best coding practices for Pytorch (for research)?**

   - ...

4. **TensorDock GPU Cloud Marketplace, H100s from $2.49/hr**

   - ...

5. **Training-free Graph Neural Networks and the Power of Labels as Features**

   - ...

6. **Current state of Chatbot pipelines in Commercial settings?**

   - ...

## GPT predicts future events


- **Artificial General Intelligence** (August 2035)
  - I predict that AGI will be achieved by August 2035 because advancements in machine learning, neural networks, and computational power are accelerating at a rapid pace. Researchers are making significant progress in developing more powerful and versatile AI systems, which could culminate in the creation of AGI within the next 15 years.

- **Technological Singularity** (November 2050)
  - I anticipate that the technological singularity will occur around November 2050 because as AI continues to advance and reach AGI levels, it will eventually surpass human intelligence. This exponential growth in technology will lead to a point where AI can improve itself at an ever-increasing rate, creating a period of unprecedented change and innovation that we refer to as the singularity.
