## GPT predicts future events


- **Artificial general intelligence** (2035): I predict that artificial general intelligence will be achieved by 2035 as advancements in machine learning, neural networks, and computing power continue to accelerate. Researchers are constantly making breakthroughs in creating more sophisticated AI systems, so it's likely that AGI will be attainable within the next 15 years. 

- **Technological singularity** (2045): I predict that the technological singularity will occur by 2045 as the exponential rate of technological advancement continues to grow. Once AGI is achieved, it will lead to a rapid acceleration of innovation and change, ultimately resulting in a point where it is impossible to predict or comprehend the implications of further technological growth. The concept of the singularity has been discussed for decades, and with the pace of technological development, it seems likely that it will happen within the next 25 years.
