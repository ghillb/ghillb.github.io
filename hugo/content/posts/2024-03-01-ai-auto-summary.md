## Possible consequences of current developments


1. **DeepMind introduces Hawk and Griffin**

   - *Benefits:*
     DeepMind's introduction of Hawk and Griffin could bring significant advancements in the fields of artificial intelligence and machine learning. These new technologies may enhance the capabilities of existing AI systems, leading to more efficient problem-solving, enhanced decision-making processes, and improved overall performance in various applications.

   - *Ramifications:*
     The introduction of Hawk and Griffin by DeepMind could also raise concerns about the ethics and implications of advanced AI technologies. There may be implications for data privacy, security, and the potential impact on the job market as automation continues to advance. It will be essential to carefully consider the potential risks and benefits of these technologies as they are further developed and implemented.

2. **[D] Why is ViT more commonly used than SWIN?**

   - *Benefits:*
     The widespread use of ViT (Vision Transformer) over SWIN (Swin Transformer) could be due to its proven effectiveness in handling computer vision tasks. ViT has shown promising results in image classification, object detection, and other visual recognition tasks, making it a popular choice for researchers and practitioners in the field.

   - *Ramifications:*
     The preference for ViT over SWIN may lead to fewer advancements in the development of SWIN-based models and applications. This could limit the exploration of alternative approaches to computer vision tasks and hinder the potential for innovation in this area. Researchers may need to carefully consider the trade-offs between different transformer models to ensure they are utilizing the most suitable option for their specific use case.
