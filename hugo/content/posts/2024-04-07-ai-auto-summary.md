## Possible consequences of current developments


1. **Any statisticians who decided on a PhD in CS rather than a PhD in Stats?**

   - *Benefits:*
     Pursuing a PhD in Computer Science rather than Statistics can provide individuals with a diverse skill set that combines the analytical rigor of statistics with the practical application and technological advancements of computer science. This interdisciplinary approach can open up a wider range of career opportunities in fields such as data science, machine learning, artificial intelligence, and software engineering.

   - *Ramifications:*
     However, focusing on computer science over statistics may lead to a lack of deep theoretical understanding in statistical methodologies. This could potentially limit the individual's ability to conduct advanced statistical analysis or contribute to statistical research. It is important for individuals in this situation to actively seek out opportunities to strengthen their statistical knowledge and skills.

2. **ML researchers who are not in NLP, what are you researching? Please share.**

## GPT predicts future events


- **Artificial general intelligence** (April 2040)
    - I predict that artificial general intelligence will be achieved by April 2040, as advances in AI research and technology are progressing rapidly, with many experts in the field predicting that AGI could be within reach within the next couple of decades.

- **Technological singularity** (June 2055)
    - I predict that the technological singularity will occur by June 2055, as exponential growth in technology and the integration of AI into various aspects of society will eventually lead to a point where the capabilities of AI surpass human intelligence, leading to a transformational event in human civilization.
