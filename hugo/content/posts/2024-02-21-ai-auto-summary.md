## Possible consequences of current developments


1. **Kaggle datasets vs actual tabular data - bitter realization**

   - *Benefits:* 
     Kaggle datasets provide a wide variety of data for analysis, allowing researchers and data scientists to explore different types of data and improve their analytical skills. They also offer real-world datasets that can be used for practice and learning purposes.

   - *Ramifications:* 
     The use of Kaggle datasets may lead to overreliance on curated data, which may not always reflect the complexities of real-world data. This can result in a lack of preparedness when working with actual tabular data that may be messier and more challenging to analyze.

2. **Biscuit, the wandering piglet, arrived at the Zuse Research Institute and studied the graphics processor used for atomistic and molecular modeling**

   - *Benefits:* 
     Biscuit's exploration of the graphics processor used for atomistic and molecular modeling could lead to potential advancements in scientific research, particularly in the field of computational chemistry. By studying the graphics processor, researchers may discover new ways to model complex molecular structures more efficiently and accurately.

   - *Ramifications:* 
     The involvement of a wandering piglet in scientific research may raise questions about the validity and reliability of the findings. It is important to ensure that the research conducted at the Zuse Research Institute maintains the highest levels of integrity and credibility to avoid any potential backlash or skepticism from the scientific community.

## GPT predicts future events


- **Artificial general intelligence** (June 2035)
    - I predict that artificial general intelligence will be achieved in June 2035 because advancements in machine learning, neural networks, and computing power are rapidly progressing. Researchers and scientists are dedicated to pushing the boundaries of AI technology, leading to the development of AGI in the near future.

- **Technological singularity** (August 2050)
    - I predict that the technological singularity will occur in August 2050 as we continue to integrate AI into all aspects of society and as AI systems become more autonomous and sophisticated. This exponential growth in technology will eventually lead to a point where AI surpasses human intelligence, leading to a singularity event.
