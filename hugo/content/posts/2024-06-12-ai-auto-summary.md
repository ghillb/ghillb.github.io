## Possible consequences of current developments


1. **Why use squared error instead of Absolute error?**

   - *Benefits:*
     Using squared error instead of absolute error in models can help in minimizing large errors significantly, as the squaring magnifies the impact of larger errors. This can lead to better convergence and overall performance of the model.

   - *Ramifications:*
     However, squared error is sensitive to outliers in the data, which can skew the results and make the model less robust. It also penalizes large errors more heavily, which may not always be desirable depending on the context of the problem being solved.

2. **What kind of jobs do a PhD in ML/AI restrict you from?**

   - *Benefits:*
     A PhD in ML/AI can qualify you for high-level research positions in academia and industry, allowing you to work on cutting-edge technologies and make significant contributions to the field.

   - *Ramifications:*
     However, having a PhD in ML/AI may restrict you from certain entry-level or mid-level positions in industry that do not require such a high level of education. It may also limit your career options outside of the ML/AI domain, as employers in other fields may not value the specialized expertise gained from a PhD in ML/AI.

3. **Check Out: Awesome Recsys Poisoning (Survey Paper)**

   - *Benefits:*
     This survey paper can provide valuable insights into the emerging trends and techniques related to poisoning attacks in recommender systems, helping researchers and practitioners enhance the security and robustness of their systems.

   - *Ramifications:*
     On the other hand, relying too heavily on this paper without critically evaluating the recommendations and methodologies presented could lead to potential vulnerabilities in recommender systems if not implemented carefully.

## GPT predicts future events


- **Artificial General Intelligence** (January 2030)
  - I predict that artificial general intelligence will be achieved in January 2030 due to the rapid advancements in machine learning, neural networks, and deep learning algorithms. There have been significant breakthroughs in AI research, and with continued efforts and investment in the field, AGI capabilities could be realized by this time.

- **Technological Singularity** (December 2045)
  - I predict that the technological singularity will occur in December 2045 as advancements in technology are accelerating at an exponential rate. Once AGI is achieved, it will lead to rapid technological progress that could surpass human intelligence, leading to the singularity. It may take some time for society to fully understand and adapt to this new era of innovation.
