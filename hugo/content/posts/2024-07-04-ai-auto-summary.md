## Possible consequences of current developments


1. **Issues in AI/ML that no one seems to talk about**

   - *Benefits:*
     Bringing attention to overlooked issues in AI/ML can lead to the development of more robust and ethical algorithms. Addressing these issues can ultimately improve the quality and reliability of AI/ML technologies.

   - *Ramifications:*
     Neglecting to address these hidden issues can result in biased algorithms, lack of transparency, and potential harm to individuals impacted by AI/ML systems. Failing to address these issues can also hinder the progress and adoption of AI/ML technologies.

2. **Automatic Image Cropping/Selection/Processing for the Lazy, now with a GUI**

   - *Benefits:*
     This tool can save time and effort for individuals who need to process images regularly by automating tasks like cropping and selection. The addition of a GUI can make the tool more user-friendly and accessible to a wider range of users.

   - *Ramifications:*
     Relying too heavily on automation for image processing tasks can lead to a reduction in the overall quality of the images. Users may also become dependent on the tool, potentially hindering their own image processing skills and creativity.
