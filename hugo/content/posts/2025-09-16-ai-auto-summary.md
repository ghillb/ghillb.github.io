## Possible consequences of current developments


1. **The quality of AAAI reviews is atrocious**
   
   - *Benefits:*
     Improving the quality of AAAI reviews could lead to a more rigorous evaluation of AI research. Enhanced reviews foster higher standards in submissions, promoting the dissemination of high-quality, reliable findings. Academics and practitioners would benefit from insights that emerge from well-evaluated papers, contributing to more effective AI systems and applications.

   - *Ramifications:*
     However, if the reviews are perceived as poor, it could discourage researchers from submitting to AAAI. This decline in submissions may result in a reduced pool of innovative ideas and hinder collaborative advancements in AI research. A reputation for subpar reviews might also diminish the conference’s stature, potentially leading to diminished attendance and less impactful discussions.

2. **The conference reviewing system is trash**

   - *Benefits:*
     Acknowledging systemic flaws in the reviewing process could motivate significant reforms. By addressing these issues, the conference could improve transparency, fairness, and inclusivity in the review process. This could ultimately enhance the credibility of the conference and encourage more diverse research contributions, beneficial for the AI community.

   - *Ramifications:*
     Conversely, labeling the system as "trash" could erode trust among participants and discourage engagement in the peer-review process. Researchers may feel demotivated to contribute if they perceive the reviews as biased or unhelpful. Such a mindset could restrict new ideas from emerging, leading to stagnation in progress within the field.

3. **AAAI 2026 phase1**

   - *Benefits:*
     The planning phase for AAAI 2026 presents opportunities for innovation in format, topics, and audience engagement. By anticipating trends and needs in AI, organizers can tailor the conference to be more relevant and impactful, providing a platform for cutting-edge research and facilitating collaborations among attendees.

   - *Ramifications:*
     If the planning does not adequately involve feedback from the academic community, it may result in a conference that fails to meet the expectations and needs of its participants. Misalignment can lead to disengagement, decreased attendance, and a potential decline in the quality of presentations and discussions.

4. **Any comments on the AAAI Review process?**

   - *Benefits:*
     Soliciting comments on the review process promotes a collaborative environment where stakeholders can voice their opinions and suggestions. This open dialogue can lead to constructive changes, paving the way for enhanced evaluation mechanisms that ultimately improve research quality and conference outcomes.

   - *Ramifications:*
     Conversely, unstructured or negative feedback without productive avenues for reform may lead to heightened frustration among contributors. It might also create a toxic atmosphere, where researchers feel disillusioned about the vetting process, potentially harming the reputation of the conference and causing participants to withdraw their support.

5. **AAAI - 2026**

   - *Benefits:*
     Focusing attention on AAAI 2026 encourages anticipation and preparation for future advancements in AI. Organizing this upcoming conference with a clear vision could enhance knowledge exchange, networking opportunities, and showcase groundbreaking technologies, benefiting researchers, practitioners, and the broader society engaged in AI.

   - *Ramifications:*
     If the event fails to live up to expectations or highlights outdated themes, it could lead to discontent among attendees. A disconnect between the event's offerings and current advancements may result in participants feeling that their time and resources were not well spent, ultimately impacting future participation in such conferences.
