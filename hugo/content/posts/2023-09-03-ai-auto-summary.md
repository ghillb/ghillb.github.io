## Possible consequences of current developments


1. **Where did the research go?**

   - *Benefits:*
   
     Understanding where research has gone can provide valuable insights into the progress of various fields. It allows researchers to build upon existing knowledge and avoid duplicating efforts. It also helps to identify areas that have received less attention and may require further investigation. Ultimately, this information can lead to more efficient and focused research, leading to advancements in various disciplines.

   - *Ramifications:*
   
     Not knowing where research has gone can lead to wasted efforts and resources. Without this information, researchers may unknowingly repeat studies or pursue avenues that have already been explored. This can result in a lack of progress and a slower pace of advancement in different fields. Furthermore, the absence of knowledge about where research has gone may hinder collaboration and the sharing of ideas among researchers, leading to a fragmented research community.

2. **10 hard-earned lessons from shipping generative AI products over the past 18 months**

   - *Benefits:*
   
     Learning from the experiences of others can help individuals and organizations avoid common pitfalls and make more informed decisions. The lessons shared in this topic can provide valuable insights into the challenges and best practices in shipping generative AI products. This knowledge can help developers and teams improve their product development processes, enhance the quality of their AI applications, and increase the chances of successful deployment.

   - *Ramifications:*
   
     Failing to learn from the experiences of others may result in repeating the same mistakes and encountering unnecessary obstacles. Without the lessons shared in this topic, developers may face difficulties in shipping generative AI products, leading to wasted time, resources, and potential negative impacts on user experience. Additionally, ignoring the lessons can hinder innovation and slow down the progress of generative AI technologies.

3. **Interview soon at an AI startup... what to expect?**

   - *Benefits:*
   
     Knowing what to expect in an AI startup interview allows job candidates to better prepare themselves. Understanding the types of questions that may be asked and the skills and qualities that are valued in the industry can help candidates present their best selves during the interview process. It can also give them insights into the company's culture, expectations, and future directions, allowing them to make more informed decisions about their career choices.

   - *Ramifications:*
   
     Going into an interview without knowing what to expect can lead to anxiety, lack of preparation, and potential missed opportunities. Candidates may struggle to answer questions effectively or showcase their relevant skills and experiences. This can result in unsuccessful interviews and missed job opportunities. Additionally, not having insights into the company's expectations and culture may lead to taking a job that is not a good fit, causing dissatisfaction and potential career setbacks.

## GPT predicts future events


- **Artificial general intelligence** (December 2030):
   - I predict that artificial general intelligence (AGI) will be developed by December 2030. AGI refers to highly autonomous systems that outperform humans in most economically valuable work. The progress in artificial intelligence and machine learning, combined with increasing computational power and knowledge, suggests that AGI development is on the horizon. Additionally, many research institutions and companies are actively working towards creating AGI, which further supports this prediction.

- **Technological singularity** (2050):
   - I predict that the technological singularity, which refers to a hypothetical point in the future when technological growth becomes uncontrollable and irreversible, will occur around 2050. This prediction is based on the exponential growth of technology and the integration of AI and other emerging technologies into various aspects of society. As advancements in technology accelerate, it is reasonable to expect that a point may be reached where technological progress becomes unpredictable and significantly impacts human civilization. However, the exact timing of the singularity is highly uncertain and subject to debate among experts.
