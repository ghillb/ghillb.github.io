## Possible consequences of current developments


1. **For those of you doing ML in bio, what does "good" data look like for you?**

   - *Benefits:*
   
     Good data in machine learning for bioinformatics can lead to more accurate predictions and better understanding of complex biological systems. High-quality data that is clean, relevant, and well-organized can improve the efficiency and effectiveness of ML algorithms, leading to advancements in drug discovery, personalized medicine, and disease diagnosis.

   - *Ramifications:*
   
     On the other hand, poor-quality or biased data in bioinformatics can result in inaccurate predictions, flawed research findings, and potential harm to patients if applied in a clinical setting. It is crucial to ensure the quality, diversity, and representativeness of data to avoid perpetuating biases or drawing incorrect conclusions in the field of ML in bioinformatics.

2. **Why do the majority of NLP models are decoder-only models?**

   - *Benefits:*
   
     Decoder-only models in natural language processing (NLP) have the advantage of being simpler, more interpretable, and easier to train compared to encoder-decoder architectures. They are often used for tasks like text generation, language modeling, and machine translation, where generating coherent and contextually relevant output is the primary goal.

   - *Ramifications:*
   
     However, using decoder-only models can limit the ability to capture complex dependencies and bidirectional context in the input data. This may result in less accurate predictions for tasks that require understanding long-range dependencies or broader context, such as question answering or sentiment analysis. Researchers need to carefully consider the trade-offs between model complexity and performance when choosing decoder-only models in NLP.
