## Possible consequences of current developments


1. **GPT-4 didn't really score 90th percentile on the bar exam**

   - *Benefits:*

     The revelation that GPT-4 did not score 90th percentile on the bar exam could lead to a more realistic expectations of AI. It will help us understand that although AI is advancing quickly, it is not perfect and still has limitations that need to be addressed. 

   - *Ramifications:*

     The revelation could undermine trust in AI and the research behind it. It may also make businesses and individuals hesitant to invest in AI technology.

2. **RWKV: Reinventing RNNs for the Transformer Era**

   - *Benefits:*

     The creation of RWKV could lead to more efficient and effective language models. It could also improve the ability of AI to understand language and context.

   - *Ramifications:*

     The creation of RWKV could make current language models obsolete, leading to the need for new investments in order to keep up with evolving AI technology.

3. **ICCV Reviews are out**

   - *Benefits:*

     The release of ICCV reviews could provide valuable insights into how far AI and computer vision technology have come. It could also provide valuable feedback to researchers and help to identify areas for improvement.

   - *Ramifications:*

     The reviews could also reveal weaknesses in AI and computer vision algorithms, potentially undermining public trust in their reliability and accuracy.

4. **GPT-4 and ChatGPT sometimes hallucinate to the point where they know they're hallucinating**

   - *Benefits:*

     This finding can help researchers understand how GPT-4 and ChatGPT work and improve their ability to diagnose issues. 

   - *Ramifications:*

     The fact that GPT-4 and ChatGPT are hallucinating raises concerns about the ethical implications of their use, especially in areas where accuracy and reliability are crucial. It may also reinforce fears that AI is capable of unpredictable and unreliable behavior.

5. **Governance of SuperIntelligence - OpenAI**

   - *Benefits:*

     The governance of SuperIntelligence is a crucial topic because it involves the development of AI that is capable of self-improvement, which could eventually result in it surpassing human intelligence. Addressing this issue could lead to the creation of guidelines to ensure the ethical and moral use of AI.

   - *Ramifications:*

     Failure to properly govern the development of SuperIntelligence could lead to catastrophic consequences, including the subjugation or extinction of the human race. It is therefore critical that this issue is taken seriously and addressed proactively.
