## Possible consequences of current developments


1. **Is it acceptable to exclude non-reproducible state-of-the-art methods when benchmarking for publication?**

   - *Benefits:*
     Excluding non-reproducible methods can lead to increased credibility and reliability of research findings. It encourages researchers to provide clear and detailed descriptions of their methods, promoting transparency and reproducibility in the scientific community.

   - *Ramifications:*
     Excluding non-reproducible methods may limit the comparison and evaluation of different approaches, potentially overlooking valuable insights or innovations. It could also result in biased assessments if certain methods are excluded based on subjective criteria, impacting the overall progress and advancement of the field.

2. **Why does my LSTM always predict the "" char/ U-0120?**

   - *Benefits:*
     Understanding why a specific character is always predicted can help identify potential issues or biases in the LSTM model. This investigation can lead to improvements in the model architecture, data preprocessing, or hyperparameters, enhancing the overall performance and accuracy of the predictions.

   - *Ramifications:*
     If the LSTM consistently predicts a specific character, it may indicate a training data imbalance or a lack of diversity in the input sequences. Failure to address this issue could result in misleading or incorrect predictions, affecting the reliability and usefulness of the model in real-world applications.

## GPT predicts future events


- **Artificial general intelligence** (2035): I predict that artificial general intelligence will be achieved by 2035 because of the rapid advancements in machine learning, neural networks, and computing power. Once AI has the ability to perform any intellectual task a human can do, we will have achieved AGI. 

- **Technological singularity** (2050): I predict that the technological singularity will occur around 2050 as the exponential growth of technology reaches a point where AI surpasses human intelligence. This event is difficult to predict with certainty, but many experts believe it may happen within the next few decades.
