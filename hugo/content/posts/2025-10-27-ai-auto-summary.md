## Possible consequences of current developments


1. **Google PhD Fellowship recipients 2025**

   - *Benefits:*
     The Google PhD Fellowship program aims to support and nurture the next generation of innovators and researchers in computer science and related fields. Recipients benefit from financial support, mentorship, and networking opportunities, which can lead to groundbreaking research advancements and collaboration opportunities. These developments can drive technological progress, enhancing artificial intelligence, machine learning, and more, ultimately benefitting society through improved services and solutions.

   - *Ramifications:*
     On the flip side, the concentration of resources and recognition on specific individuals may perpetuate existing inequalities in academia. It could lead to a narrower view of research priorities, as recipients may feel pressure to align their work with Google's interests. This may stifle diversity in thought and innovation, hindering broad advancements in various domains.

2. **Suggestion Preparation for Nvidia Job Interview**

   - *Benefits:*
     Preparing for job interviews with companies like Nvidia can enhance candidates’ self-confidence and interview skills, increasing their chances of securing positions at top tech firms. These jobs often offer competitive salaries and opportunities to work on cutting-edge technology, thereby driving career growth and advancement in the tech sector, which can lead to broader economic benefits.

   - *Ramifications:*
     High-pressure environments associated with preparation can lead to anxiety and burnout amongst job seekers. Additionally, the emphasis on technical skills may overshadow the importance of soft skills like communication and teamwork, potentially leading to a workforce that lacks well-rounded interpersonal capabilities essential for collaborative environments.

3. **Cutting Inference Costs from $46K to $7.5K by Fine-Tuning Qwen-Image-Edit**

   - *Benefits:*
     Dramatically reducing costs for AI inference can make powerful image-editing technologies more accessible to small businesses and individual creators. This democratization of AI resources can spur innovation across various creative industries, enabling users to develop competitive, high-quality products without huge financial investments, thus driving economic growth.

   - *Ramifications:*
     While cost-effective solutions benefit many, they may exacerbate issues of over-reliance on AI technologies, raising concerns over job displacement, especially in creative fields. Furthermore, reduced costs may also attract malicious use of these technologies, leading to ethical concerns surrounding deepfakes and misinformation.

4. **Building Low-Cost GPU Compute in Africa**

   - *Benefits:*
     Establishing affordable GPU compute resources in Africa can catalyze technological development and innovation across the continent, empowering local startups and researchers. Improved access to computing power can support advances in AI, data science, and other fields, fostering economic growth and creating jobs.

   - *Ramifications:*
     However, if not managed properly, the rush to deploy technology could lead to insufficient infrastructure, widening the digital divide. Additionally, the influx of foreign investment may focus on short-term gains rather than sustainable development, potentially undermining local initiatives and self-sufficiency.

5. **Clojure Runs ONNX AI Models Now**

   - *Benefits:*
     Running ONNX AI models in Clojure allows developers to leverage the interop advantages of both technologies, enabling rapid prototyping and deployment of machine learning applications. This can optimize performance, reduce development times, and expand the potential user base of machine learning technologies, fostering innovation.

   - *Ramifications:*
     Despite these advantages, there may be challenges regarding community support and documentation, as Clojure is less widely adopted than other programming languages. The niche status may hinder collaborative efforts and knowledge sharing, potentially slowing down the pace of development and adoption of AI solutions within the Clojure community and beyond.

## GPT predicts future events


- **Artificial General Intelligence (AGI)** (March 2035)  
  I predict that AGI will emerge by March 2035 due to the rapid advancements in machine learning, neural networks, and computational power. As researchers continue to develop more sophisticated algorithms and leverage larger datasets, the potential for creating systems that can understand, learn, and apply intelligence in a generalized manner increases significantly.

- **Technological Singularity** (November 2045)  
  The technological singularity is predicted for November 2045, as advancements in AI will likely lead to an exponential growth in technology and a capacity for self-improvement. The convergence of numerous technologies, including quantum computing, bioscience, and AI, may create a tipping point where machines surpass human intelligence and alter societal structures dramatically.
