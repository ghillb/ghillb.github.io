## Possible consequences of current developments


1. **[P] I made pkld a cache for expensive/slow Python functions that persists across runs of your code**

   - *Benefits:*
     - This tool can significantly improve the performance of Python applications by caching the results of slow or expensive functions, reducing the need to recalculate them each time the code is run. This can lead to faster execution times and more efficient use of computational resources.

   - *Ramifications:*
     - While using a cache can improve performance, it is essential to manage the cache size and expiration properly to avoid potential issues like memory bloat or stale data. Additionally, there may be cases where caching could lead to incorrect results if not implemented correctly.

2. **[D] Have transformers won in Computer Vision?**

   - *Benefits:*
     - Transformers have shown promising results in computer vision tasks, surpassing traditional convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in certain areas such as image captioning and image generation. They offer a new perspective on handling visual data and have the potential to improve performance in various computer vision applications.

   - *Ramifications:*
     - While transformers have made significant progress in computer vision, there are still challenges to address, such as scalability issues with large-scale datasets and computational inefficiency. Researchers and practitioners need to carefully evaluate the appropriate use cases for transformers in computer vision to maximize their benefits.

3. **[D] Should I focus on Leetcoding or is an unpaid academic ML internship worth it?**

   - *Benefits:*
     - Leetcoding can help improve problem-solving skills and algorithmic thinking, which are valuable for technical interviews and competitive programming. On the other hand, an academic ML internship can provide practical experience, exposure to real-world projects, and networking opportunities in the field of machine learning.

   - *Ramifications:*
     - The decision between focusing on Leetcoding or pursuing an unpaid academic ML internship depends on individual goals and priorities. While Leetcoding may help with short-term goals like securing a job, an academic internship can offer long-term benefits such as gaining hands-on experience and building a strong foundation in machine learning. It's crucial to consider the trade-offs between theoretical knowledge and practical skills when making this decision.

## GPT predicts future events


- **Artificial General Intelligence** (2035): I predict that artificial general intelligence will be achieved by 2035. Advancements in machine learning, deep learning, and neural networks are progressing rapidly, and many experts believe that AGI is the next milestone in artificial intelligence development.

- **Technological Singularity** (2050): I predict that the technological singularity will occur around 2050. As technology continues to evolve at an exponential rate, it is likely that a point will be reached where machines surpass human intelligence, leading to unpredictable and rapid technological growth.
