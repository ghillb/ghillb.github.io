## Possible consequences of current developments


1. **Why isn't GNN in high demand in industry?**

   - *Benefits:*
     - GNNs (Graph Neural Networks) have the potential to revolutionize various industries by effectively modeling data with complex relationships and dependencies. They can be used in areas such as social network analysis, recommendation systems, drug discovery, and fraud detection, leading to more accurate predictions and insights.

   - *Ramifications:*
     - The lack of demand for GNN in industry could slow down advancements in various applications where GNNs could provide significant benefits. This could result in missed opportunities for improved decision-making, efficiency, and innovation in industries that could benefit from GNN technology.

2. **A visual deep dive into Tesla's data engine as pioneered by Andrej Karpathy.**

   - *Benefits:*
     - Understanding Tesla's data engine and the work of Andrej Karpathy can provide insights into innovative approaches to handling and analyzing large volumes of data. This knowledge could inspire advancements in data management, processing, and utilization in various industries, leading to improved efficiency and decision-making.

   - *Ramifications:*
     - The deep dive into Tesla's data engine may reveal proprietary information or strategies that could potentially be misused or replicated without proper authorization. This could lead to legal issues, data breaches, or unethical practices in data handling and analysis.

## GPT predicts future events


- **Artificial general intelligence** (2035): I predict AGI will become a reality by 2035 as advancements in machine learning, neural networks, and computing power continue to progress rapidly. Researchers are making significant strides in creating algorithms that can simulate human intelligence across a wide range of tasks, and with the increasing investment in AI research, the development of AGI seems increasingly plausible within the next 15 years.

- **Technological singularity** (2045): The technological singularity, the hypothetical moment when AI surpasses human intelligence and triggers an explosion of technological progress beyond our control, is likely to occur around 2045. As AI capabilities continue to improve exponentially, we may reach a point where machines can rapidly learn and improve themselves, leading to a rapid acceleration of progress in various fields. This event could have profound implications for society and the future of humanity.
