## Possible consequences of current developments


1. **How to develop/debug distributed training code before training in the cloud?**

   - *Benefits:*
   
     Developing and debugging distributed training code before training in the cloud allows for faster iteration and troubleshooting. It enables researchers to identify and fix potential issues early on, saving time and resources. This process also ensures that the code is optimized for efficient distributed training, leading to better performance during actual runs.

   - *Ramifications:*
   
     The potential benefit of developing and debugging distributed training code on local machines before moving to the cloud could result in overlooking cloud-specific issues. If not thoroughly tested in a cloud environment, the code may encounter unexpected problems during actual training. Additionally, local resources may not accurately reflect the scale and performance of cloud resources, leading to suboptimal training results.

2. **Is there any ML research regarding software verification?**

   - *Benefits:*
   
     ML research on software verification can lead to the development of tools and techniques to ensure the correctness and reliability of ML models and systems. This can improve the safety and security of AI applications in critical domains such as healthcare, autonomous vehicles, and finance.

   - *Ramifications:*
   
     On the other hand, relying solely on software verification for ML models may introduce overhead and complexity to the development process. It could potentially slow down innovation and deployment if the verification procedures are too stringent or impractical to implement effectively. Striking a balance between verification and agility in ML development is crucial to ensure both reliability and efficiency.
