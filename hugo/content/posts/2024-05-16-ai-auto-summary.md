## Possible consequences of current developments


1. **jaxsplat: 3D Gaussian Splatting for JAX**

   - *Benefits:*
     The use of 3D Gaussian splatting for JAX could lead to more efficient and accurate data visualization and analysis in machine learning tasks. This method allows for the representation of spatial information in a more realistic and precise manner, improving the performance of models and algorithms that rely on 3D data processing.

   - *Ramifications:*
     However, the implementation of such a technique may require high computational resources and could potentially increase the complexity of existing machine learning pipelines. Additionally, there may be challenges related to the interpretability of results obtained through this method, as the intricacies of 3D Gaussian splatting may not be easily understandable for all users.

2. **What's up with papers without code?**

   - *Benefits:*
     Requiring papers to provide code alongside their research findings can lead to increased reproducibility and transparency in the field of machine learning and artificial intelligence. Access to code allows other researchers to verify results, build upon existing work, and accelerate the pace of innovation in the community.

   - *Ramifications:*
     However, mandating code availability may pose challenges for researchers who work in proprietary environments or on sensitive datasets. It could also create barriers for those who may not have the resources or expertise to properly document and share their code. Additionally, there may be concerns regarding code quality, as some researchers may prioritize functionality over cleanliness and maintainability.

## GPT predicts future events


- **Artificial General Intelligence** (May 2035)
    - I believe that artificial general intelligence will be achieved by 2035 as we continue to see rapid advancements in AI technologies and machine learning algorithms. Researchers are constantly pushing the boundaries of AI capabilities, and given the current pace of innovation, it is reasonable to predict that AGI may be within reach in the next few decades.
  
- **Technological Singularity** (July 2047)
    - The technological singularity, where AI surpasses human intelligence and leads to exponential technological growth, is a more unpredictable event. I predict it may happen around 2047 based on current AI development trends and the potential for AI to continuously improve itself at a faster rate than humans could. As AI becomes more autonomous and capable of self-improvement, we may reach a point where technological progress accelerates beyond our control.
