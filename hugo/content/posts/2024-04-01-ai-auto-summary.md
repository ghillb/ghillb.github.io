## Possible consequences of current developments


1. **What's more impressive in a ML portfolio: implementing a paper or creating a good project?**

   - *Benefits:*
     Implementing a paper can showcase your ability to understand complex algorithms and techniques in machine learning. It demonstrates your technical proficiency and ability to work with cutting-edge research. On the other hand, creating a good project shows your practical skills in developing real-world applications of machine learning, which can be more impactful and relevant to potential employers.

   - *Ramifications:*
     While implementing a paper can demonstrate your theoretical knowledge, it may not always translate into practical skills that are required in industry settings. On the other hand, focusing solely on creating projects may overlook the importance of understanding foundational concepts in ML. Striking a balance between implementing papers and creating projects can showcase a comprehensive skill set that includes both theoretical knowledge and practical experience.

2. **The AI industry spent 17x more on Nvidia chips than it brought in in revenue**

   - *Benefits:*
     Investing in Nvidia chips signifies the industry's commitment to leveraging high-performance computing resources for AI applications. This could lead to advancements in AI research and the development of more sophisticated AI models.

   - *Ramifications:*
     However, the significant cost of utilizing Nvidia chips compared to the revenue generated raises questions about the sustainability and profitability of the AI industry. It highlights the need for optimizing costs and exploring alternative hardware solutions to ensure the long-term viability of AI companies.
