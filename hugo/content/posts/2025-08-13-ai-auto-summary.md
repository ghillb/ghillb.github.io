## Possible consequences of current developments


1. **The Current AI Conference Model is Unsustainable!**

   - *Benefits:*
     Transitioning from the traditional conference model to a more sustainable approach could reduce environmental impact significantly. Virtual and hybrid conferences can increase accessibility for diverse participants globally, fostering collaboration and accelerating innovation in AI research. By adopting new formats, we may also save costs related to travel and venue arrangements.

   - *Ramifications:*
     A shift from physical to virtual conferences could lead to decreased networking opportunities and reduced personal interactions, which are often crucial for collaboration. Additionally, the challenge of maintaining academic rigor in virtual settings may arise, with concerns about the quality and depth of discussions. The traditional revenue streams for conferences, such as registration fees, could diminish, affecting organizations that rely on these funds.

2. **Statement on the Originality of OpenRLHF and veRL FSDP RLHF**

   - *Benefits:*
     This statement can foster trust in the AI research community by emphasizing the importance of originality and transparency in contributions. It can encourage researchers to build on existing knowledge responsibly, propelling innovation in Reinforcement Learning and promoting collaborative efforts to further improve RL model performance.

   - *Ramifications:*
     An emphasis on originality might lead to restrictive practices that stifle collaboration, as researchers may hesitate to share ideas or results for fear of being accused of lack of originality. Furthermore, the focus on proprietary advancements might hinder the open-source spirit of research, creating silos rather than a collaborative environment.

3. **Promising Research Directions for VLMs in the Medical Domain**

   - *Benefits:*
     Leveraging Vision-Language Models (VLMs) in medicine could enhance diagnostic accuracy, streamline healthcare workflows, and personalize patient care. By interpreting medical images alongside textual information, VLMs can facilitate better decision-making, potentially leading to improved outcomes and reduced healthcare costs.

   - *Ramifications:*
     The deployment of VLMs in healthcare raises concerns regarding privacy and data security, as sensitive patient information may be exposed. Additionally, reliance on machine learning in critical decision-making can introduce biases and inaccuracies, potentially compromising patient safety and undermining trust in healthcare systems.

4. **REINFORCE++-baseline is all you need in RLVR**

   - *Benefits:*
     Highlighting a simplified baseline for Reinforcement Learning Variational Research (RLVR) can accelerate research, providing a clear, effective starting point for experiments and innovations. This could lead to faster advancements in fields that rely on RL, such as robotics or autonomous systems.

   - *Ramifications:*
     However, oversimplification could encourage researchers to overlook complex aspects of RL, leading to a lack of depth in understanding and application. Additionally, if the baseline becomes too popularized, it may stifle creativity, as researchers might be less likely to explore alternative methods that could yield innovative breakthroughs.

5. **Multiple Submission Policy at EMNLP 2025 for Workshops**

   - *Benefits:*
     A multiple submission policy could foster wider participation by allowing researchers to share diverse ideas and insights, enhancing the overall quality of workshops at EMNLP 2025. This approach promotes experimentation and may lead to innovative research discussions, ultimately contributing to advances in NLP.

   - *Ramifications:*
     However, allowing multiple submissions could lead to an overwhelming number of contributions, making it difficult for reviewers to maintain quality standards. It may also result in the dilution of focus within workshops if many similar topics arise, complicating the selection of high-quality papers and potentially frustrating participants.

## GPT predicts future events


Here are my predictions for the events of artificial general intelligence and technological singularity:

- **Artificial General Intelligence** (April 2029)  
  AGI is anticipated to arise from ongoing advancements in deep learning, reinforcement learning, and neuromorphic computing. With the rapid growth in computational power and the increasing availability of large datasets, I believe a breakthrough that leads to AGI will occur around this time due to the convergence of these technologies.

- **Technological Singularity** (October 2035)  
  The singularity is expected to happen as a result of the exponential growth in AI capabilities following the development of AGI. Once AGI is capable of self-improvement, it will likely accelerate technological progress to an extent that is unpredictable. Therefore, approximately six years after the arrival of AGI, I predict the singularity will manifest as societal changes that fundamentally alter human existence and our relationship with technology.
