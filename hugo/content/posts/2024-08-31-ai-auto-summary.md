## Possible consequences of current developments


1. **AI PhD advice - top university required?**

   - *Benefits:*
     
     Attending a top university for an AI PhD program can provide access to cutting-edge research, state-of-the-art resources, and networking opportunities with leading experts in the field. This can enhance the quality of education and research output, potentially leading to better job prospects and career opportunities in academia, industry, or research institutions.

   - *Ramifications:*

     However, the pressure to attend a top university for an AI PhD program may create a highly competitive environment, leading to increased stress and mental health issues among students. Additionally, the emphasis on prestigious institutions may marginalize talented individuals who cannot afford or access such opportunities, limiting diversity and inclusion in the AI research community.

2. **What RL algorithm should I try for a multi-agent card game?**

   - *Benefits:*
     
     Choosing the right reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm for a multi-agent card game can lead to improved performance, strategy development, and decision-making in complex environments. Experimenting with different algorithms can help researchers and practitioners better understand the strengths and weaknesses of each approach, leading to advancements in AI techniques for game playing and real-world applications.

   - *Ramifications:*

     However, the selection of an inappropriate RL algorithm for a multi-agent card game can result in suboptimal outcomes, inefficiencies, and wasted time and resources. Using complex algorithms without proper understanding or tuning may lead to overfitting, instability, or lack of convergence, hindering progress in developing effective AI solutions for the game.
