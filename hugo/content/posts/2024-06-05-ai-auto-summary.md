## Possible consequences of current developments


1. **mamba.np: pure NumPy implementation of Mamba**

   - *Benefits:*
   
     - Developing a pure NumPy implementation of Mamba can potentially lead to improved performance and efficiency for certain operations. NumPy is known for its speed and ease of use, which could benefit users who prefer a Python-based workflow.
   
   - *Ramifications:*
   
     - However, relying solely on NumPy may limit the capabilities of the implementation compared to using more specialized libraries or frameworks. It could also introduce potential compatibility issues with other tools or environments that are not built on NumPy.
   
2. **Inversion by direct iteration**

   - *Benefits:*
   
     - Direct iteration for inversion can provide a simple and intuitive way to solve problems that involve matrix inversion. It may be suitable for small to medium-sized matrices and could offer a straightforward implementation for educational purposes.
   
   - *Ramifications:*
   
     - However, direct iteration methods may be computationally expensive and slow for large-scale matrices. They might also lack the numerical stability and robustness of more advanced inversion techniques, leading to inaccurate results in certain scenarios.
