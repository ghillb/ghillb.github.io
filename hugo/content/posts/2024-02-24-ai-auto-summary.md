## Possible consequences of current developments


1. **Generative Models: What do they know? Do they know things? Let's find out!**

   - *Benefits:*
     Generative models can provide valuable information about scene intrinsics such as normals, depth, albedo, and shading. This can be extremely useful in various fields such as computer vision, robotics, and augmented reality where understanding the underlying structure of a scene is crucial.

   - *Ramifications:*
     However, the reliance on generative models for extracting scene intrinsics can raise concerns about privacy and security. If these models are not handled carefully, they may inadvertently reveal sensitive information from images or scenes, leading to potential privacy breaches.

2. **Modern Dimensionality Reduction**

   - *Benefits:*
     Dimensionality reduction techniques can help in simplifying complex datasets and improving the efficiency of machine learning algorithms. This can lead to faster model training, better visualization of data, and improved performance in tasks such as clustering and classification.

   - *Ramifications:*
     However, improper use of dimensionality reduction methods can result in loss of important information from the data, leading to poor model performance and inaccurate results. It is crucial to understand the limitations of these techniques and choose the right method based on the specific requirements of the problem at hand.

3. **When writing ML software - how do you use TDD?**

   - *Benefits:*
     Test-Driven Development (TDD) can help in ensuring the reliability and robustness of machine learning software by writing tests before implementing the actual code. This can lead to better code quality, faster delivery of features, and easier maintenance of the software.

   - *Ramifications:*
     However, strict adherence to TDD in machine learning projects may sometimes slow down the development process, especially when dealing with complex models or constantly changing requirements. It is important to strike a balance between test coverage and agility to ensure that the development process is efficient and effective.
