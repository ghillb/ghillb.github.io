## GPT predicts future events


- **Artificial General Intelligence:** 
    - By **2050** - Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) refers to highly autonomous systems that outperform humans at most economically valuable work. Predicting exactly when AGI will be achieved is difficult due to various factors such as technological advancements, funding, and research progress. However, it is reasonable to expect that within the next 30 years, significant breakthroughs will take place in the field of AI, leading to the development of AGI. With the current rate of progress in machine learning, robotics, and computational power, it is plausible to expect AGI by 2050.
        
- **Technological Singularity:**
    - By **2075** - Technological Singularity refers to a hypothetical future event where technological growth becomes uncontrollable and irreversible, resulting in unforeseeable changes to human civilization. As AGI develops and continues to surpass human intelligence in various domains, it will lead to an exponential acceleration of technology and significantly shape society. While predicting the exact timeline of the singularity is highly uncertain, based on the projected advancement of AGI and subsequent technologies, it is conceivable that the singularity may occur within the next 50-60 years, around 2075. However, it is important to note that the concept of the singularity is highly theoretical and is debated among experts in the field.
