## Possible consequences of current developments


1. **ICCV 2025 Desk Reject for Appendix in Main Paper Anyone Else?**

   - *Benefits:*
     An open discussion regarding desk rejects allows researchers to share experiences, fostering a sense of community and support. This transparency can lead to better understanding and adherence to submission guidelines, helping to improve paper quality and clarity in academic communication.

   - *Ramifications:*
     Frequent desk rejects may discourage researchers, particularly newcomers, leading to a perception of elitism in academia. If professionals feel their work is unfairly judged, it could deter innovation and result in fewer contributions from diverse perspectives.

2. **Should my dataset be balanced?**

   - *Benefits:*
     A balanced dataset enhances the model's performance and generalizability by reducing bias. This can lead to fairer AI applications, ensuring that minorities are represented accurately, thus improving overall societal equity and trust in technology.

   - *Ramifications:*
     Overemphasizing balance might lead researchers to overlook important nuances in unbalanced datasets, where minority categories may carry significant context. This could result in models that generalize poorly in real-world scenarios, inadvertently perpetuating biases.

3. **Seeking Advice on Fine-tuning QWQ-32B Model**

   - *Benefits:*
     Fine-tuning powerful models like QWQ-32B can yield substantial improvements in task-specific performance. This customization allows businesses and researchers to leverage advanced AI capabilities tailored to their unique needs, enhancing efficiency and accuracy.

   - *Ramifications:*
     The focus on specific model tuning raises concerns about overfitting and transferability. Models may excel in certain applications but fail in others, leading to a false sense of security in their applicability and undermining robustness in diverse contexts.

4. **Resources for the Score Based Generative Models?**

   - *Benefits:*
     Access to quality resources on score-based generative models can accelerate innovation in fields such as art, music, and data synthesis, enhancing creative expression and enabling new forms of media production.

   - *Ramifications:*
     Misuse of generative models could lead to ethical dilemmas, such as copyright infringements or the creation of misleading content. Without proper guidance, there's a risk of proliferating low-quality or harmful outputs.

5. **Evaluating Video Models on Impossible Scenarios: A Benchmark for Generation and Understanding of Counterfactual Videos**

   - *Benefits:*
     This research can deepen our understanding of complex scenarios that traditional models struggle with, potentially advancing AI’s capabilities in simulation and prediction. It may also enable more sophisticated analysis in areas like decision-making and consequences in uncertain environments.

   - *Ramifications:*
     The focus on “impossible” scenarios could lead to models that operate well in theory yet lack practical applicability. Additionally, it risks promoting unrealistic expectations about AI capabilities, contributing to a gap between public perception and actual performance.

## GPT predicts future events


- **Artificial General Intelligence (AGI)** (September 2028)  
  AGI is rapidly advancing due to breakthroughs in machine learning, neural networks, and computational power. Current trends indicate that we may achieve AGI within the next few years, especially as collaborative research increases and funding for AI technologies surges. The pace of innovation and integration of AI into various domains support this optimistic timeline.

- **Technological Singularity** (March 2035)  
  The technological singularity, where AI outpaces human intelligence and begins to improve itself autonomously, is likely to occur after AGI is achieved. As AGI develops, we can expect exponential advancements in technology and intelligence. This creates a feedback loop of improvement that can lead to the singularity. The timeline takes into account the necessary societal and ethical adaptations that must occur alongside technological growth.
